# Helmet_Detection_YOLOv8

The project aims to develop a YOLOv8-based model for the detection of traffic violations, specifically targeting non-helmet riders. By leveraging state-of-the-art object detection techniques, the system will automatically identify instances of motorcycle riders not wearing helmets in real-time from surveillance footage or live camera feeds. This initiative aligns with efforts to enhance road safety and enforce helmet regulations, particularly in regions where non-compliance is prevalent, such as India.

## Prerequisites

* T4 GPU
* python

## Usage

1) run Untitled.ipynb file in T4 GPU runtime and get best.py file.
2) now run main.py and use the obtained best.pt file.
